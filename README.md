# Logistic-Regression-Examples

Logisitc Regression is used for:
- Classification Problems
  - Yes or no. 1 or 0
  Ex: Is this email spam or not? 
  Ex: Did this team make money or not?
 Â 
There are binary class and multi class classification problems
- Muli-class means y could be in y={0,1,2,3} (Four classes). Y can be equal to 0, 1, 2 or 3
- Binary class means y={0,1} (2 classes). Y can only be equal to 0 or 1

To use, need a target y variable available. Couldn't use to determine if a case was fraudulant or not if not fraudulant field already exists

For Binary class:
- 0 <= h(x) <= 1 where h is our hypothesis function
- h(x) = g(x)
